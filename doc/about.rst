About ``mybinder.org``
======================

This page explains some of the teams and organizations behind mybinder.org.

What technology runs mybinder.org?
==================================

The technology behind mybinder.org is primarily composed of three open-source projects:

* `JupyterHub <https://z2jh.jupyter.org>`_, which manages cloud infrastructure for user instances
* `repo2docker <repo2docker.readthedocs.io>`_, which builds Docker images from GitHub repositories
* `BinderHub <binderhub.readthedocs.io>`_, which orchestrates the above two projects and
  provides the Binder interface.

Each of these are open and inclusively-governed projects. Currently, these are all officially
hosted as a part of Project Jupyter, an open project that creates open tools for data science
infrastructure and interactive computation. The mybinder.org team is
heavily involved in each, though mybinder.org does not need to have a controlling
stake in any of them.

Who runs mybinder.org?
======================

mybinder.org is a single deployment of the BinderHub technology. It is run as a free, public
service to the scientific and educational community. It also serves as a way for the Binder
project to test the "cutting edge" of Binder and demonstrate the technology.

Currently, the mybinder.org team is comprised of the `Binder Project team <https://jupyterhub-team-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/team.html#binder-team>`_.
However, as time moves on we expect that these two teams will start to diverge as more
institutions deploy BinderHub for their own purposes, and want to help govern the direction
of the project.

What kind of an organization is the mybinder.org team?
======================================================

The mybinder.org team is currently housed as a member of Project Jupyter, which is
itself housed under NumFocus, a 501c3 non-profit. 

Who pays for mybinder.org?
==========================

Currently, the BinderHub deployment at mybinder.org is paid for with a
`grant from the Moore Foundation <https://figshare.com/s/e9d0ad7bdc4e405cccfa>`_.
