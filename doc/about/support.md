# Support the project

This page describes the kinds of support that Binder receives, as well as how you can support the Binder project.

## Our major costs

In addition to developing and maintaining the many open source tools built by this project, we also have a few extra costs:

- **Cloud expenses for mybinder.org**: The service at mybinder.org serves tens of thousands of sessions each week, each of which run in the cloud.
  We pay for this infrastructure via donations of credits and money from the community.
- **Personnel to operate mybinder.org**: Running a heavily-used and complex cloud service requires expertise in cloud infrastructure development and operation.
  We receive in-kind contributions from several individuals and organizations to help us sustain these operations.

## Donate to our cloud operations fund

The easiest way to support the mybinder.org team is to provide a financial contribution to our cloud operations fund.
This is administered by [NumFocus](https://numfocus.org) and is used to pay for the cost of developing, operating, and paying the cloud bill for Binder.

## Provide cloud credits for mybinder.org

## Operate cloud infrastructure with us

The Binder team operates a variety of BinderHub deployments across many cloud providers via [the BinderHub Federation](federation.md).
If you have cloud infrastructure, or the skills to operate cloud infrastructure, we invite you to join the BinderHub Federation by offering to assist with running a BinderHub deployment.
Even better, you can offer to [deploy and operate a new BinderHub Federation member](federation/joining)!

## Help with our open source efforts

Finally, all of the techology behind mybinder.org is built by an open community.
We welcome any kind of contributions and support.
You can find many ways to contribute to the Binder community, codebase, and services at [](../contribute.md).

## Attribution for team members
